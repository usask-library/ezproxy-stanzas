# EZproxy Stanzas

This repository contains database stanzas for use with EZproxy. It contains stanzas contributed by the EZproxy user community (in the `contrib` directory) as well as plain text copies of those maintained by [OCLC](https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management/EZproxy/Database_stanzas) (in the `OCLC` directory).

This repository also functions as the core of the [Costanza](https://github.com/usask-library/costanza) EZproxy management system.
